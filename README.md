# DnDLetItRoll
This MVC App was created to fulfill the project requirements for the Code Kentucky C# Programming (2) course.

This is a unofficial companion app for Dungeons and Dragons the TTRPG that allows DMs to share information on Races, Classes, and Background with the player. It also allows
    players to add homebrew elements for each of those categories.
    
To run this app, please view the package management console and update database.

Launch the app by clicking 'Run'.

Features:

This App is an MVC App built with EF. It reads and writes data to a database and displays the values in the app. Per Ernesto, this is a feature that would fulfill a Features list requirement.
This App creates lists, populate them with several values, retrieves at least one value, and use it in the app.
This App creates a least one Unit Test.

Future Improvements:

I hope to eventually add more classes/entities that will represent all features of the D&D game and add the coresponding data to the data base. I also would like to implement a character creation part of the app that 
functions just like if the player were creating a character from the playerhandbook with their DM helping.
